                <div class="modal-text">Ten years back, we had nothing called cryptocurrencies. And then, one fine day
                    back in 2009, somebody with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto released the whitepaper of Bitcoin to a
                    mailing list, and cryptocurrencies came into the picture.

                    In the initial few years of its existence, only a couple of crypto enthusiasts were involved in
                    Bitcoin and related activities. Gradually, by 2013 as Bitcoin started to gain traction, various
                    other cryptocurrencies followed through. And now we have over 5000 cryptocurrencies in the crypto
                    market.</div>

                <div class="modal-text">Crypto tokens are digital assets that offer functionality over and above what a cryptocurrency does. 

The best analogy to understand the difference is currency vs shares. Both of these have intrinsic value, but the token is valued in terms of the cryptocurrency. 

So, a crypto token on Ethereum will be valued in terms of the Ether cryptocurrency. You can, of course, extrapolate this value into regular currency such as INR. Ethereum has by far become the most popular blockchain for crypto tokens. It uses its own Ether cryptocurrency on it.

These tokens are typically issued via initial coin offerings (ICOs) by companies to fund projects. The difference is, instead of raising US dollars, or Indian Rupees, or Euros, they raise funding via the native token of the blockchain they exist on, like Ether or Bitcoin or NEO. 

Investors are given tokens that they can redeem for a product or service or something else of value. Unlike shares in a company that provides an ownership stake in the company, crypto tokens do not offer ownership. At no point is the investor part-owner in the company.</div>

                <div class="modal-text">The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies has thrust a new set of jargons onto
                    investors. Tokens, blockchain, smart contracts, decentralised apps etc., are becoming a part of our
                    everyday vocabulary on cryptocurrencies or specific platforms.

                    I know that these terms may sound like complex jargons, but the truth is that they are actually
                    simple concepts to understand.

                    The blockchain technology underpinning the first original cryptocurrency ‘Bitcoin’ has evolved two
                    more generations since its inception.

                    Ethereum, the second generation blockchain used to create smart contracts, is bringing forth
                    strategic evolutions across multiple industries, including finance, insurance, healthcare and more.

                    But what are smart contracts, and how do they work?

                    Let us find out.
                    Smart contracts are self-executing programs stored on a blockchain that run when pre-defined terms
                    and conditions are met.

                    In other words:

                    They are a set of computer codes that run on blockchain technology. And constitute a set of
                    pre-defined rules which are agreed upon by the involved parties.

                    Smart Contracts help verify, enforce, and execute digital transactions without third parties’
                    involvement once these predefined rules are met.

                    Simply put:

                    Smart contracts are designed to eliminate the need for middlemen such as a lawyer or a bank
                    representative for getting a job done. The terms of agreement and contracts are written directly
                    into lines of code. Upon fulfilment of the conditions laid out, the smart contracts self-execute the
                    transaction.

                <div class="modal-text">Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is not illegal in India.

                    With over 10 million Indian investors, it is not only not illegal, but it also enjoys tremendous
                    support from a large and growing crypto community in India.

                    India has come a long way in the cryptocurrency sector. From straight out banning banks from trading
                    crypto in 2020 to looking to create a digital “national crypto” currency, the Indian government is
                    deeply immersed in this sector.
                    “Bitcoin is not illegal; It’s unregulated.”

                    This is where people often get it wrong, Bitcoin isn’t illegal, but yes, it’s unregulated. The
                    government hasn’t restricted people from buying, selling and holding cryptocurrencies. Anybody can
                    freely trade in Bitcoin or any of the other cryptocurrencies.
                    Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, operate on a decentralised network called blockchain, which is
                    out of any individual or entities reach.

                    Blockchain was built to decentralise the financial ecosystem, which is otherwise heavily
                    centralised. The prevailing banking system has a central authority that directs its working.

                    Decentralisation ensures that no one person or authority has complete control over the crypto
                    market’s functioning.

                    Hence, it becomes difficult for the government to govern something which is out of their control.
